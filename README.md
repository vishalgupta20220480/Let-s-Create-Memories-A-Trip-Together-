This fun web project asks your crush to go out with you using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If they click "No," the page redirects and asks again until they click "Yes." The final page displays "Hurrah, I know you love me!" signaling the end. It's a playful, interactive way to ask someone out with simple web technologies.
