# Let-s-Create-Memories-A-Trip-Together-
This fun web project asks your crush to go outside with you. If they click "No," the button flies away and keeps moving until they click "Yes." Once "Yes" is clicked, it redirects to a final page saying, "Hurrah, I know you love me!" Built with HTML, CSS, and JS.
